ZR fixes (as part of 0.302000):
[ ] info->{nullable} vs !info->{is_nullable}
[ ] create_item() local$@


[X] Hoist the number/hashref->arrayref conversion to all levels
[X] Add references in strings for relationship names
[X] Catch circular references
    [X] Successive attempts to create the same thing (maintain a stack?)
[X] Generalize handling of column types to numeric, decimal, and character.
    * Right now, only "int" and "varchar" are handled.
    * Also error out when a non-NULL column with an unknown type happens
[X] Don't require cycle-breaking with nullable FKs
[-] Add auto-generation of:
    [ ] negative values
    [X] datetime values
    [ ] enum/set (based on values from database)
    [ ] json (is this even reasonable?)
[ ] Oracle RAW(16) doesn't get read correctly.
[ ] Add a test where the table's PK has no auto-increment
    * This should be handled by not-null + unique, but just verify.
[ ] Add children to meet to level of constraint
    [ ] Document constraints better (?)
[ ] Fix depth search in Runner::create_search()
    [ ] NO FAILING TEST??!
[ ] Provide a sim function that can use back-references
    [ ] to created rows
    [ ] to other columns of this row
